Templer System Manual
=====================

This manual covers the templer code generation system. Templer is a
refactoring and improvement of the ZopeSkel_ code generation tool, used by the
Plone_ and Zope_ communities for years. However, unlike its predecessor
templer is not limited specifically to generating packages for Plone_ or
Zope_. With templer you can get a quick start building python-based projects
for a number of systems and frameworks.

Everyone--perhaps especially those who have used ZopeSkel_ in the past--should
take a look at the introduction pages. The templer system consists of a number
of inter-related packages, and you'll want to learn what is offered, and what
you'll need to do to get started.

If you are new to using the templer system, you'll want to spend some time
familiarizing yourself with the users manual.

If you are interested in extending the templer system with your own templates,
read the developers manual.
