Templer Developer's Manual
==========================

The templer developer's manual will provide the information a developer needs
to be able to create new templates to address their own particular needs.

The following are topics this manual will address:

* Structure of a templer plugin

* Making a new template

    * Am I subclassing something to do so?
    
    * What classes are available?
    
    * Why would I choose one over another?
    
    * How do I make a template?

* How do I ask questions of the end-user?

    * What types of questions are available?
    
* How do I insert responses into the template?

* What is a template?

* What is a structure?

* Why/when would I use a template vs. a structure?
